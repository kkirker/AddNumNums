# Javascript code test

> This is an unfinished protoype for a dashboard idea.
> The lead developer won a ticket to Google I/O and needs you to finish it. 

**Instructions**

- When you type in a number to the text box and press "Add Sales" it should show you the number on the widget.
- It should also show you the number on the dashboard.
- TODO: Dislay a list of every value added to the dashboard so we can audit and update the values later.
- TODO: Add a visual validation if the sales are negative by setting the text to red.
- TODO: What are the next steps to move this out of the prototype stage and into production code?
